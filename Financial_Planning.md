# Financial Planning

As a financial planner, it is paramount to help clients to structure a plan that enhances financial health, achieves financial goals, and into favourable retirement. In this assignment, APIs are utlised to create two financial analysis tools; Alpaca Markets API will be used to pull historical stocks and bonds information and Alternative Free Crypto API will be used to retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.  These tools allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund. Next, Alpaca API is used to etch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.  Following this, I will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount for different portfolios.
